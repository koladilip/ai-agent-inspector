# Combined: Release Please (create/update Release PR, then tag+release on merge) + PyPI publish.
#
# Triggers:
# - push to main → release-please runs; if it created a release, publish runs.
# - push to tag v* → only publish runs (manual release path).
#
# Use conventional commits (feat:, fix:, BREAKING CHANGE:). Merge the Release PR
# to create the tag and release; publish runs in the same run or on the tag push.
#
# One-time setup:
# - GitHub: create environment "pypi".
# - PyPI Trusted Publisher: workflow name must be "release-and-publish.yml" (this file).
# If releases aren't created on merge: add PAT as RELEASE_PLEASE_TOKEN.
