# Release Please: creates/updates a Release PR from conventional commits.
# When you merge that PR, this action creates the tag (e.g. v1.0.0) and GitHub Release.
#
# CONNECTED TO publish.yml: the tag push from this workflow triggers publish.yml
# (on: push: tags: v*), which publishes to PyPI. So: merge Release PR → tag created
# → publish.yml runs → package on PyPI.
#
# Use conventional commits: feat:, fix:, BREAKING CHANGE: etc.
# See https://www.conventionalcommits.org/
